    The contemporary fields of the study of culture, the humanities and the
    social sciences are unfolding in a dynamic constellation of cultural turns.
    This book provides a comprehensive overview of these theoretically and
    methodologically groundbreaking reorientations. It discusses the value of
    the new focuses and their analytical categories for the work of a wide range
    of disciplines. In addition to chapters on the interpretive, performative,
    reflexive, postcolonial, translational, spatial and iconic turns, it
    discusses emerging directions of research. Drawing on a wealth of
    international research, this book maps central topics and approaches in the
    study of culture and thus provides systematic impetus for changed
    disciplinary and transdisciplinary research in the humanities and beyond -
    e.g., in the fields of sociology, economics and the study of religion. This
    work is the English translation by Adam Blauhut of an influential German
    book that has now been completely revised. It is a stimulating example of a
    cross-cultural translation between different theoretical cultures and also
    the first critical synthesis of cultural turns in the English-speaking
    world.
